## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

This project leverages a modern ecosystem to ensure performance, type safety, and developer experience:

* **⚛️ React 18:** Library for building the component-based UI architecture.
* **📘 TypeScript:** Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.
* **⚡ Vite:** Next-generation frontend tooling for ultra-fast development and optimized builds.
* **💨 Tailwind CSS (v3):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive, and consistent styling without leaving the HTML.
* **📕 Storybook:** An isolated environment to build, test, and document UI components independently from the main app.
* **🚀 GitHub Pages:** Automated hosting for the static documentation via CI/CD pipelines.

## 🏗 Architecture: Atomic Design

The library is organized following the **Atomic Design** methodology to ensure modularity:

* **Atoms:** Basic building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Typography).
* **Molecules:** Groups of atoms functioning together (Project Cards, Form Groups).
* **Organisms:** Complex UI sections (Responsive Grids, Navbars).
