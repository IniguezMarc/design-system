# Getting Started

Welcome to **Marc's Design System**. This guide will help you get up and running with the project locally.

## 📦 Installation

This project is built with **Vite** and **React**. To install dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running Storybook

To start the development environment and view the component library:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook server (usually at `http://localhost:6006`), where you can explore:
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Badges).
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (Cards, Search bars).
- **Organisms**: Complex sections (Navbar, Hero, Footer).
- **Pages**: Full page layouts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Tooling**: Vite, Storybook
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier

## 📦 Usage in External Projects

If you want to use a component from this library in another project:

1.  **Copy the Code**: The easiest way is to copy the component file (e.g., `Button.tsx`) and its dependencies (like `index.css` or Tailwind config) directly into your project.
2.  **Dependencies**: Ensure your project has the required dependencies installed (React, Tailwind CSS, etc.).
3.  **Import**: Import the component in your project:
    ```tsx
    import { Button } from './components/atoms/Button/Button';
    ```

> **Note**: In the future, this library could be published as an NPM package for easier installation (`npm install @marc-design-system/ui`).
